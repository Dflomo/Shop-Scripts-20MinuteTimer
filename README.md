# Shop-Scripts-20MinuteTimer

20 Minute Email Tracker

This company depends heavily on outsourcing the monitoring of our inbox, and heavily on google applications. I took it upon myself
to automate this process using Google Script (Javascript Flavor), to filter/monitor the inbox, while also recording data, updateing data 
and clearing the spreadsheet appropriately. 

Successfully used Script Properties to record and update the running of the script to strict time guidelines and business hours (6:00am - 
10:00pm). This also updates these times per 24hrs.

By using Google Spreadsheets as a makeshift DB schema, I was able to accurately record and update neccessary data (email ID, email time/date,
email subject line, number of notification sent).

By creating three different "helper" functions, I am able to update the recorded information accordingly, record all deleted information in 
another spreadsheet, update the deleted spreadsheet accurately, and transition certain emails, when unstarred, to the correct sheet. 

The application sends three notifications, before "deleteing" the information and copying it to the other spreadsheet.
