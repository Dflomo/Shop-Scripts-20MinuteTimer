# Shop-Scripts_TwentyMinTimer


## Getting Started
  This code base was developed in hopes of make a highly postive impact on the demand of focus that it takes for someone to manually look over the inbox. The code primarily creates an autonomous solution to the manually counting and acquiring of email information. The script sends out three notifications at 20 minute intervals, looking for emails that sit in the inbox for that long. 

### Prerequisites
  Google Script enviroments where the user has the authority to export information about the currently connected inbox and spreadsheet suites of Google.
  
  Basic programming knowledge, and knowledge of basic Javascript.


### Installing
  No installation necessary. Proper function names, and importing of the code, along with a manual execution to set the Google Script property variables the first time. 
  
  You will also need to comment out the Google Script properties section once the variables have been set for your time zone.
  
## Running the tests
I recommend using the Log.logger("blah") functionality to get a better idea. The debugger is pretty decent as well. 

## Deployment
  Deployed within the Google Suite of the same account that you want to analyze

## Built With
Google Script (Javascript flavor) solely
